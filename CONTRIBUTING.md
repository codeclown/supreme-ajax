# Contributing

## Code conventions, code style

Yea is written as pure JavaScript with no precompilation (other than minification for the distributed version).

## Documentation

Documentation of all methods should be kept up-to-date in two places:

- `README.md` – Extensive documentation for each method, with examples
- `index.d.ts` – 1-to-2 sentence documentation for each method, with minimal examples

## Changelog

Each change should be complemented with a bulletpoint in CHANGELOG.md under "Upcoming".
